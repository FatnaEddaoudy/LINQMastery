    Window Layout for a simple application that uses two buttons
    to toggle between two messages in a label control.
    
    Changed the window title to reflect the application's purpose.

        give the label control some space around the edges
        make its font large enough to see from a distance
        center the text in the grid
        
        Assign the label to the top left cell (0,0)
        and spread it across both columns

        typically, buttons are positioned at the bottom of the window
        and arranged left-to-right
        
        leave a little room around the edges of each button so that 
        page elements don't directly contact each other - I used uneven
        margins to make the shape more elongated, but still with the same 
        margin left, button and right. This could have been accomplished
        by making the button row smaller, but then it would have moved
        the label down as well.
        
        give the buttons a name so that the click handler in the C# code
        has a name that is clear as to its function
        -->
        <Button Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="0"
                Name="FirstPress" Content="Press Me" FontSize="35" Margin="10, 50, 10, 10"
                Click="FirstPress_Click"/>
        <Button Grid.Row="1" Grid.Column="1"
                Name="SecondPress" Content="Press Me Again" FontSize="35" Margin="10, 50, 10, 10"
                Click="SecondPress_Click"/>
    </Grid>
