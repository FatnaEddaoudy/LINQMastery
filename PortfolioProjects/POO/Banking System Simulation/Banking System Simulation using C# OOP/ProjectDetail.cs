//---------------------Objective:--------------------------

//Define the properties and methods of a class

//Define constructors

//Create a class instance

//Access properties of an object through getters and setters (read/write)

//Apply methods

//Define static attributes and methods

//-----------------Work to do:------------------------

//Define a Client class with the following attributes:

//CIN(ID number)

//LastName

//FirstName

//Phone

//Use properties to define the access methods (getters/setters) for the class attributes.

//Define a constructor that initializes all the attributes.

//Define another constructor that initializes only CIN, LastName, and FirstName.

//Define the method Display() that prints the information of the current client.

//Define an Account class characterized by:

//Its balance

//A code(account number) that is incremented automatically each time an account is created

//Its owner, who is a Client

//Use properties to define the access methods for the attributes of the class (the account number and balance are read-only).

//Define a constructor that creates an account for a given owner.

//Add the following methods to the Account class:

//Credit(amount) → adds money to the account.

//Credit(amount, fromAccount) → credits the current account and debits the fromAccount.

//Debit(amount) → subtracts money from the account.

//Debit(amount, toAccount) → debits the current account and credits the toAccount.

//A method to display the summary of an account.

//A method to display the total number of accounts created.

//Create a test program for the Account class.




//----------What I learned from this project:-------------------

//Practicing encapsulation using properties and private fields.

//Creating constructors with overloading.

//Using objects that contain other objects (an Account has a Client).

//Working with static attributes (counting the number of accounts).

//Writing methods that interact with each other (Credit and Debit).

//Building a console test program to try out all features.
