# LINQMastery

A comprehensive collection of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) exercises and examples in C#. This repository contains various projects demonstrating different aspects of LINQ functionality, from basic queries to advanced operations.

## Projects Overview

This repository is organized into separate folders, each containing a complete C# project focusing on specific LINQ concepts:

### Core Exercises
- **Exercise1** - Basic LINQ fundamentals (WPF Application)
- **Exercise15** - Advanced LINQ operations
- **Exercise16-29** - Progressive LINQ exercises covering various scenarios

### Specialized Topics
- **Bibliothèque** - Library management system using LINQ
- **C# Sharp LINQ Exercises, Practice** - Comprehensive practice exercises
- **IMMOBILIER** - Real estate data processing with LINQ
- **TRADE** - Trading and financial data analysis
- **LINQ Playground** - Experimental LINQ operations
- **LINQ to Objects** - Focus on LINQ to Objects operations

## Getting Started

Each folder contains a complete Visual Studio solution (.sln) with its corresponding project files. To run any exercise:

1. Navigate to the desired exercise folder
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework or .NET Core/5+
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (or Visual Studio Code with C# extension)

## Structure

Each project follows a similar structure:
```
ExerciseName/
├── ExerciseName.sln
├── ExerciseName/
│   ├── Program.cs (or MainWindow.xaml for WPF)
│   ├── ExerciseName.csproj
│   └── ... (additional source files)
├── bin/ (build output - ignored by git)
└── obj/ (build cache - ignored by git)
```

## Learning Path

For beginners, we recommend following this learning path:
1. Start with **Exercise1** for basic concepts
2. Progress through **Exercise15-29** in order
3. Explore specialized projects like **Bibliothèque** and **IMMOBILIER**
4. Use **LINQ Playground** for experimentation

## Contributing
